# Project Name
Annual Salary to Monthly Cost Calculator

## Description

_Duration:  15 hours_

In this project I designed a calculator that allows you to enter in your employee information (first name, last name, id number, job title, and annual salary) to calculate what the monthly cost is and see what your remaining budget is for the month. I also added a functionality to project the monthly budget for the next year with a 3% salary increase for the existing employees.
